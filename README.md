# SMS- Spam Classifier
An SMS spam classifier project involves building a machine learning model to distinguish between spam and non-spam text messages. 
It starts with collecting and preprocessing data, followed by selecting and training a suitable model. The model's performance is 
evaluated, optimized if necessary, and then deployed for real-time classification of incoming messages, helping users filter out unwanted spam.
